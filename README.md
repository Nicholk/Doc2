The Developer Portal is the designated development environment used for importing applications, staging, testing, and production. The Developer Portal requires an identity realm for managing companies and users with external and internal accounts. Components of Covisint Developer Portal consist of:

● Platform Applications and APIs (e.g. Connect, CCA and Identity APIs)
● Platform Application Services (e.g. API Gateway, databases and consolidated logging)
● Platform Administration (e.g. Developer Portal) and SDKs that provide application access to the platform 
libraries that can be found via GitHub.
